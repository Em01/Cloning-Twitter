#Cloning Twitter
This was a weekend test at Makers Academy given to us by our coach Alex Peattie. The challenge was to reimplement the Twitter feed page using HTML, CSS and JS. We were told to concentrate solely on the front-end of the page. Although i did not complete this test i hope to return to it at a later date.
