#Cloning Twitter
![](Twittertest.png?raw=true)

This was a weekend test at Makers Academy given to us by our coach @alexpeattie. The challenge was to reimplement the Twitter feed page using HTML, CSS and JS. We were told to concentrate solely on the front-end of the page. Although i did not complete this test i hope to return to it at a later date. At this point i will continue work to ensure it replicates the twitter page. I will also add Javascript to ensure that it has infinite scrolling and work to make the page responsive.
